# MerinoClient.Core
The core dependency of my personal projects, modified [ReMod.Core](https://github.com/RequiDev/ReMod.Core) to **my code style/liking for my personal purposes**. Most of the credit still goes to [@RequiDev](https://github.com/RequiDev)!

## Building
First install latest MelonLoader relase from here: [Automated installer](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README?id=automated-installation). Launch the game once and wait to get post MelonLoader intilization screen. After that, first navigate to `<vrchat install dir>/MelonLoader` and drop required libraries to `MerinoClient.Core/Depedencies`. After we have dropped the base MelonLoader functionality related libraries we will also need the game's dumped libraries that can be found in `<vrchat install dir>/MelonLoader/Managed` and repeat the same process of drag and drop.

## Contribution
I don't currently really care about contributions at this time, since I usually like to develop on my own, but in case you're using this "fork" of [ReMod.Core](https://github.com/RequiDev/ReMod.Core) and want to improve the code feel free to create a pull request!
