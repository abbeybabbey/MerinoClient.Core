## Building
First install latest MelonLoader relase from here: [Automated installer](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README?id=automated-installation). Launch the game once and wait to get post MelonLoader intilization screen. After that, first navigate to `<vrchat install dir>/MelonLoader` and drop required libraries to `MerinoClient.Core/Depedencies`. After we have dropped the base MelonLoader functionality related libraries we will also need the game's dumped libraries that can be found in `<vrchat install dir>/MelonLoader/Managed` and repeat the same process of drag and drop.
